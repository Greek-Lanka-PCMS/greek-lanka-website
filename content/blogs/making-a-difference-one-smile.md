## A Day to Remember: Spreading Smiles at Imbulgolla Primary School, Matale, Sri Lanka

**February 21st, 2025 – A Day of Compassion, Unity, and Hope**

On February 21st, 2025, our hearts were full, and our spirits were lifted as we witnessed the profound impact of our CSR initiative at Imbulgolla Primary School in Matale, Sri Lanka. Harbour of Smiles, a CSR project powered by Greek Lanka Maritime Services, brought joy to 60 enthusiastic students who, despite their humble circumstances, radiated hope, talent, and resilience.

What began as a simple act of giving blossomed into an unforgettable experience that touched the hearts of the children and reaffirmed our commitment to making a tangible difference in the lives of those in need.

## Preparation Meets Purpose

In the weeks leading up to this momentous day, the team at Harbour of Smiles dedicated countless hours to planning and organizing the event. From selecting the right school supplies to preparing a day full of surprises and care, no detail was left to chance. The outcome was an impactful and heart-warming CSR project that strengthened our bond with the community and left a lasting impression on everyone involved.

## Gifts That Inspire

On the day of the event, we were welcomed by the warm embrace of students, teachers, and parents, who had been preparing for this day with excitement and anticipation. As part of our initiative, we provided these talented young learners with essential school supplies, including books, pens, and stationery. But the most memorable gift was the full set of Western band equipment donated to the school – a donation that promises to help nurture the musical talents of these children and give them the tools they need to reach their full potential.

The students, who had previously made music using handmade instruments, welcomed us with melodies from their hearts. Their creativity and spirit were a powerful reminder of their incredible potential, even in the most challenging circumstances.

## A Heartfelt Welcome

Beyond the material gifts, the true essence of the day lay in the moments of connection, kindness, and mutual respect shared by all. The school’s teachers and parents, who work tirelessly to support their children, greeted us with heartfelt warmth. They even treated us to a delicious breakfast and shared incredible performances that showcased their children’s talents, including dancing, singing, and heartfelt tributes that reflected their dreams and aspirations.

This experience deeply humbled us, reaffirming our belief in the power of human connection and how even the smallest acts of kindness can create profound change.

## Supporting Families, Building Futures

Many of the children we met that day come from underprivileged families, where daily survival depends on modest wages. Few have parents in stable government jobs, and many live in financial hardship. By providing these students with school supplies, we know that we did more than offer them material items – we also lightened the load on their families, helping pave the way for a brighter and more hopeful future.

At Harbour of Smiles, we are committed to improving lives through action, not recognition. We proudly fund our CSR efforts through Greek Lanka Maritime Services, ensuring the impact is directly felt by the communities we aim to serve. Our belief is simple: we give not for recognition but because it’s the right thing to do.

## A Promise to Continue

This experience has been a powerful reminder that the true measure of fulfillment comes not from what we gain but from what we give. We promise to continue making a difference, one smile at a time.

We would also like to extend our deepest gratitude to our valued customers at Greek Lanka Maritime Services. Your continued support enables us to contribute to the maritime industry and the communities we serve. By choosing our services, you are indirectly helping us create positive change in Sri Lanka.

Our commitment to excellence goes beyond ship agency services. At Greek Lanka Maritime Services, we take pride in our responsibility to humanity.

A special thank you to the Greek Lanka Family for your dedication, hard work, and unwavering spirit in bringing this initiative to life.

This unforgettable day at Imbulgolla Primary School was a testament to the power of kindness and community spirit. As we look ahead, we remain committed to continuing our journey of making a meaningful impact, one smile at a time.
